**xpeak** is a (hopefully) user-friendly command-line interface to **espeak**, which allows the user to read large text files aloud with fine-grain control of the reading process.
**espeak** is a compact open source software speech synthesizer for Linux, Windows and other platforms (source: Wikipedia).
**xpeak** accepts a text file as input, splits it into sentences according to userâ€‘definable rules, and forwards the sentences one at a time to be read by **espeak**. The user can stop, pause and restart the reading at any time, skip to the next/previous sentence, jump to a specific sentence by number, look for a sentence containing some text, etc. Commands are entered using single keystrokes, which allows an easy control of the program.
A small companion script included in the installation package (**xtxt**) enables the user to set up conversion pipelines to extract text from different types of files according to their mimetypes or file extensions. Combined with conversion utilities such as **unoconv**, this greatly expands the scope of the program, e.g., by enabling the user to use **xpeak** with DOCs, ODTs, PDFs, etc. (It can also be very useful as a standalone application.)
